1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,050
I'm a fan of the original Ultraman.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,550
I would say I like it
more than Ultra Seven.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:08,920
What did you like the most about it?

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:11,090
My favorite were the Alien Zarab.

5
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:12,460
Alien Zarab.

6
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,860
They're minor characters though.

7
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,030
Alien Zarab.

8
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,260
I like that they're the exact
opposite of Ultraman.

9
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,300
Coming to Earth is part of their job.

10
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:24,170
Destroying humans and
destroying other life forms is their job.

11
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,140
That's what I liked about them.

12
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,640
They show that there are aliens that
are on the opposite side of Ultraman.

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,640
I also like the imitation Ultras.

14
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,380
I love fakes.

15
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,820
No one can tell the difference.

16
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,890
You can usually tell between
two different kinds of cats.

17
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:44,790
It's a lot more difficult
when dealing with aliens.

18
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,930
There's barely any differences.

19
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:52,760
Weren't there a lot of imitations
that had slight color variations?

20
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,640
Their scarf would be yellow, or
they'd have black on their uniform.

21
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,840
All they had to do
was change their color.

22
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:01,640
What is Ultraman doing?

23
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,540
Different page from the same book.
What is Ultraman doing?

24
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:03,310
Yeah, the same book.

25
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,410
Just folded weirdly.
Yeah, the same book.

26
00:01:04,709 --> 00:01:08,580
You get the feeling that
the fakes could take over.

27
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,780
Which kaiju do you like the best?

28
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,480
It's gotta be Neronga.

29
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,150
Neronga.

30
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,650
Oh, and Dodongo.

31
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:15,490
Dodongo.

32
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,220
Anno, how about you?

33
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:19,160
Oh, I like Ultraman.

34
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,890
My favorite is the original Ultraman.

35
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:23,460
What about kaiju?

36
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,360
I'm not all that interested in kaiju.

37
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:25,930
Really?
I'm not all that interested in kaiju.

38
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,630
You weren't paying attention to them.

39
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:29,300
I saw them at least.

40
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,570
There was a night scene with a green
kaiju and a building between them.

41
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:33,110
That was cool.

42
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,010
That's what you were watching.

43
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:37,310
What exactly did you
like about Ultraman?

44
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:40,510
Hmm, what is it about
the original Ultraman?

45
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,450
He's an alien.

46
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,080
Yes.

47
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,150
It's amazing, yet makes you
feel a little uncomfortable.

48
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:50,120
In the A-type, it felt like
he was a person.

49
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,060
His lips were slightly
parted, and it was scary.

50
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:57,930
The A-type Ultraman
was frightening to me as a kid.

51
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,100
I wondered if there was a person
like that somewhere in the world.

52
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,070
After he collided with officer
Hayate, before he fused with him,

53
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,070
he was laughing like, "Ha ha
ha, there is nothing to fear."

54
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,140
That's easy for an alien to say.

55
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:14,350
They eventually came out with not
only A-type but also B-type and C-type.

56
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,650
Which do you prefer?

57
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,280
I like B-type.

58
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,350
Which one was B-type?

59
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,950
This area kind of all flowed together
upward in an aesthetically pleasing way.

60
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,720
Combat-wise he has the best exterior.

61
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,690
I like how strong he looks.

62
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:27,030
He's muscular.

63
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,890
The muscles.
He's muscular.

64
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:29,330
B-type.

65
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,730
He looks the most like a hero.
B-type.

66
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,970
Doesn't his mouth move sometimes?
A-type has the wrinkly part at his mouth.

67
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:36,870
A-type?

68
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:41,570
His mouth and body are probably
masked with a skintight material,

69
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,280
so it gives off the feeling that he's naked.

70
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,610
Didn't he initially have the gimmick
to open and close his mouth?

71
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,380
Along that line of thought though...

72
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,620
It doesn't really look like a mask.
Along that line of thought though...

73
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,190
It was his face.
It doesn't really look like a mask.

74
00:02:53,190 --> 00:03:01,190
B-type has the hard mask so it looks like
a person wearing a wetsuit and mask.

75
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:06,600
When the first suit was all wrinkled
up, it ended up looking like skin.

76
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,270
Just imagine watching
Hide fighting naked.

77
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:09,870
Wait...

78
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:11,140
That's the feeling.

79
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:11,840
That mental image...
That's the feeling.

80
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:11,870
Is that pattern supposed to be pants?
That's the feeling.

81
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,970
Is that pattern supposed to be pants?

82
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,280
They're styled like blood flow.

83
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,280
He doesn't have any muscles either.

84
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,080
All he has is an arbitrary
pattern right here.

85
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,480
Furuya Bin's physique is scary.

86
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,550
That's where our
conversation has led us.

87
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:29,390
I guess his posture is
what stands out more.

88
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,490
The Specium Ray pose.

89
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,130
It was the beginning of that famous pose.

90
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,090
Did you think the
Specium Ray was cool?

91
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,300
As a gimmick?

92
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,500
Up until then, crossing your arms to
produce a beam hadn't been done.

93
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,870
That was cool.

94
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,570
Amazing. Absolutely brilliant.

95
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,840
To think a beam would release
from crossing your arms like this.

96
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,480
Ok, so, all of you have
worked as directors before.

97
00:03:53,480 --> 00:04:01,720
If you were to direct an Ultraman series,
what kind of story would you create?

98
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:05,390
I would want to redo the Earth
Defense Force adequately.

99
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:05,890
Adequately? Just the EDF?

100
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,290
I want to focus on that organization.
Adequately? Just the EDF?

101
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,230
The organization?

102
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,330
Yeah, I want to run the organization
through all kinds of situations.

103
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,770
Is that so?

104
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,500
The stars from the originals
wouldn't have to show up.

105
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,070
Like who?

106
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,770
Ultraman. I mean, he can show
up at the end, for the final scene.

107
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:22,740
Jeez.

108
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,540
What a cheeky thing to say.
Jeez.

109
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:23,640
Jeez.

110
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,810
I would want to revitalize the characters.

111
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,550
Properly revitalize the aliens.

112
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,050
Like the Baltan?

113
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:38,020
Yeah, even all the Ultras
would be great to revamp.

114
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:44,530
As is, Ultraman is fantastic. The
whole world gladly accepts him.

115
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,800
But, he clearly isn't living
in our current reality.

116
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,970
That's for sure.

117
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:57,780
Humans haven't joined hands to create
world peace or anything like that, yet.

118
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:04,350
If Ultraman showed up we'd ask, "What
are you going to do? What's your role?"

119
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:12,760
That's something I think about a lot.
Would humans today lend him a hand?

120
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,560
But that isn't really Ultraman.

121
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,690
That's true,

122
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:21,230
You had the chance to watch
Ultra Q and the original Ultraman.

123
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:25,700
What kind of influence do
you think that had on you?

124
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,910
If it weren't for Ultraman, I don't
think I would be in this line of work.

125
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:28,810
Really?

126
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:34,280
I'm here because it
affected my generation.

127
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,150
I wouldn't be here without Ultraman. I'd
be doing something completely different.

128
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,720
Seeing it had a
significant impact on me.

129
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:48,690
I'm a bit removed
from your generation,

130
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:52,630
but I think it was pivotal that it
captured people like me as well.

131
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:59,040
What we loved won't be as beloved by
kids 3 or 4 generations down the line.

132
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,610
Simply put, we have to put our best
foot forward so that kids watching now

133
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:11,480
will look up to our work and want to
make their own when they grow up.

134
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,620
That's the kind of position we hold.

135
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,820
That's true.
That's the kind of position we hold.

136
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:15,550
That's the kind of position we hold.

137
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,320
True.
That's the kind of position we hold.

138
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:27,300
Long ago, I fit into part of this costume.

139
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:30,770
Up to my wrist was fine, but trying
to fit my stomach was a problem.

140
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,440
That was fun.
